## Real Time Bus Tracker
Marking the map along the bus stops between MIT and Harvard

## Description
Project working with asynchronous code. I worked with moving around the marker, but still figuring out how to make it move.

## How to run
Grabbing a location from MapBox and marking stops with longitude and latitude.

## Roadmap of future improvements
Learning to work with this project better, and understand it more thoroughly.
