# mapMarker
Marking the map along the bus stops between MIT and Harvard

# Title: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: Project working with asynchronous code. I worked with moving around the marker, but still figuring out how to make it move.

How to run: Grabbing a location from MapBox and marking stops with longitude and latitude.

Roadmap of future improvements: Learning to work with this project better, and understand it more thoroughly.
